% You need to return the following variables correctly.

% =========================================================================
% What this code will perform:
%
%               Concretely, if an email has the text:
%
%                  The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
%
%               Then, the word_indices vector for this text might look 
%               like:
%               
%                   60  100   33   44   10     53  60  58   5
%
%               where, we have mapped each word onto a number, for example:
%
%                   the   -- 60
%                   quick -- 100
%                   ...
%
%              We will take one such word_indices vector and construct
%              a binary feature vector that indicates whether a particular
%              word occurs in the email. That is, x(i) = 1 when word i
%              is present in the email. Concretely, if the word 'the' (say,
%              index 60) appears in the email, then x(60) = 1. The feature
%              vector should look like:
%
%              x = [ 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ... 0 0 0 0 1 ... 0 0 0 1 0 ..];
%


for i = word_indices
    x(i) = 1;
end
